This is a backup with a fix so one may reload & make use of pybrain3, its neural network framework, and its datasets.

Where needed, look to {https://github.com/ForkInABlender/ChatGPT_solutions_produced_from_simple_prompt/tree/2025_09/pybrain3_custom_layers/MAML/main_shards/2025/html}<br>
 for additional patches equally compatible with pyodide.js .

Recommended python versions are python3.12 for termux ( raw -- no chroot/proot/bootstrap )  or with termux+andronix of ubuntu, use python3.10.

knowing this, you'll also need the {https://github.com/ForkInABlender/scipy-correcteds/} in order to use this on your phone or PC or docker container {https://hub.docker.com/r/de3343/ai_mods_py3.10}
